      You've just opened your Potions Caf√© in the middle of the world's greatest
      magical city, New Arkadia. With open doors you receive your first
      customers, only to discover that everyone is in a hurry to go elsewhere
      and does not have the patience to wait for their orders for long. In a
      hurry, you start creating potions and giving them to your customers. It's
      going to be hard but the rent doesn't pay for itself.
