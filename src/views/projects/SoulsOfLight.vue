      You wake up in the middle of a cold dark forest, at your side lies a metal
      lamp, a weak ember appears to burn inside it. In front of you an enormous
      castle opens its rusted gates to you. With no other option you decide to
      enter the castle, as you advance you notice that thorny vines cover the
      walls. A chill runs down your spine, you try to remember who you are, why
      you are here, but your mind is blank. Who knows what other mysteries lie
      ahead in this darken path.
